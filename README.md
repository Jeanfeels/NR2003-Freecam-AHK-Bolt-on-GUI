# NR2003-Freecam-AHK-Bolt-on-GUI
Autohotkey v1.1 script to give a basic GUI to activate shortcuts in Tyler Mallon's Nascar 2003 Freecam utility


Autohotkey has a function that allows you to convert a script to an executable, so this repository is mainly so I have somewhere to host both the AHK code (which you can run or edit as you please) and the built .exe
